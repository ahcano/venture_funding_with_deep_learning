# Venture Funding with deep learning
This project analyzes data from a csv source file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Machine learning and Neural Networks features are applied to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.
